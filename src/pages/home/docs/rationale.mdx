Pocket is a library for building small applications and universal components that can be rendered by any framework that uses hyperscript functions or [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html). Like many frameworks, it provides a component-based model to create interfaces combined with state management, page routing, and style encapsulation.

## How does Pocket work?

<br/>

{/* The [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) plugin [esbuild-plugin-pocket]() makes it easy to compile your components for ReactDOM, Vue.js render functions, Superfine, and Custom Elements (with the help of Superfine). Using a generic compatibility layer components use the same virtual dom used by the parent application.

This compatibility layer enables developers to build components using a generic, simple, and stable architecture without worrying about using complicated web apis, bundling a second view layer, or rebuilding a component for every framework. Pocket makes no compromises. */}
