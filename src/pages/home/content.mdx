  Pocket is a library for building small applications and universal components that can be rendered by any framework that uses hyperscript functions or [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html). Like many frameworks, it provides a component-based model to create interfaces combined with state management, page routing, and style encapsulation.

  ## How does Pocket work?

  <br/>
  <CodeTabs tabs={tabs}/>

  {/* The [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/) plugin [esbuild-plugin-pocket]() makes it easy to compile your components for ReactDOM, Vue.js render functions, Superfine, and Custom Elements (with the help of Superfine). Using a generic compatibility layer components use the same virtual dom used by the parent application.

  This compatibility layer enables developers to build components using a generic, simple, and stable architecture without worrying about using complicated web apis, bundling a second view layer, or rebuilding a component for every framework. Pocket makes no compromises. */}

  ## Prior art

  Pocket was influenced by many frameworks. I'd like to showcase the following projects here as the primary sources of inspiration.

  + [Hyperapp](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/hyperapp)
  + [Superfine](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/superfine)
  + [Mithril](https://mithril.js.org/)
  + [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
